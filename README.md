Movie Recommendation System

 Overview
This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. By analyzing user ratings and preferences, the system suggests personalized movie recommendations to users, enhancing their movie-watching experience.

 Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilized collaborative filtering algorithms to generate movie recommendations based on user ratings and preferences.
- **Matrix Factorization**: Implemented matrix factorization techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Alternating Least Squares (ALS) to model user-item interactions and extract latent factors for recommendation.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Incorporated content-based filtering methods to supplement collaborative filtering, taking into account movie attributes such as genre, actors, and directors.
- **User Interface**: Developed a user-friendly interface to allow users to input their preferences, view recommended movies, and provide feedback on suggested recommendations.
- **Scalability**: Designed the recommendation system to handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring scalability and performance even with a high volume of users and movies.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implemented evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the recommendation algorithms.

 Usage
To use the movie recommendation system:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the main application script, `main.py`, and follow the instructions to interact with the recommendation system.
4. Input your movie preferences, explore recommended movies, and provide feedback to refine future recommendations.

 Future Enhancements
- Integration of deep learning techniques for enhanced recommendation accuracy and feature representation learning.
- Incorporation of hybrid recommendation approaches combining collaborative filtering with content-based and knowledge-based methods.
- Deployment of the recommendation system as a web application, allowing users to access recommendations from any device with an internet connection.
